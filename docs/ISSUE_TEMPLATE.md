Please read and verify the following before submitting an issue:

- [x] You are **_using the latest version_**. If not, your issue may have already be fixed in later versions.
- [x] You have **_checked [the manual][0]_** to ensure your issue is not the intended behaviour or whether something can be configured to alleviate your issue.

- [x] The **_title of the issue should be brief and representative_** of the issue being submitted as it is shown when listing/searching issues and may help others find it.
- [x] If you are willing and able, **_[Pull Requests][5] to fix the issue are welcome_** and are the most effective and efficient way to improve Geany. If you plan on working on fixing the issue, please indicate this below.
- [x] **_Additional [information about bug reporting][6] is available_** on the website, such as getting a "backtrace" which can be extremely useful to debug crashes and other weird behaviour.
- [x] **_Be kind_**. Even if you are really frustrated by an issue or that it even exists, please remember everyone involved in the project are volounteers and no one is being paid to work on it or provide support for it.

# Expected behaviour

If you are experiencing a crash, lockup or other strange behaviour and are able to provide a debugging backtrace, that would be extremely helpful. (Tip: put the pasted backtrace in one of the Markdown `code blocks` so it is well-formatted and readable)
